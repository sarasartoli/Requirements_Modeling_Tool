# Requirements_Modeling_Tool
this tool is used to model and analyze socio-technical systems requirements. the tool  is developed using Java and SPARC programming languages. the program consists of a parser that reads a JSON file that represents a goal model. The parser writes a SPARC file that includes the library of violations (i.e. as a set of ASP rules). The program then gets the output from the ASP solver, as shown in Figure 1. The output is currently a list of ASP predicates that gives the violation found and the goal or task that created the violation.
