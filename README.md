# Requirements_Modeling_Tool
this tool is used to model and analyze socio-technical systems requirements. the tool  is developed using Java and SPARC programming languages. Figure 1 shows the different software components which compromise the overall framework. There are 2 main blocks: 
## Develop ASP rules block. 
This block takes as input a JSON-based goal model, creates sorts, predicates, facts and ASP rules capable of representing the goal model under analysis. The output of this block is an ASP program that can be used in the other blocks for the purpose of Well-formedness and Satisfaction analysis.

## Goal Model Wellformedness analysis block. 
This block takes as input the ASP program generated by Develop ASP rules component, adds domain independent well-formedness analysis ASP-rules to the existing program, uses an external block to executes the ASP program using, and outputs correction recommendations to the requirements engineer if the goal model is not valid. The recommendations are useful to elicit more requirements or find inconsistencies in the goal models.
